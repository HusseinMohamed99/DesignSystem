## Design System

A Design System is a comprehensive guide that defines the design standards, principles, components, and patterns used to maintain visual and functional consistency across a product or suite of products. In the context of application or web development, it helps ensure a cohesive user experience and simplifies collaboration between designers and developers.

Key Elements of a Design System:
Foundations:

Color Palette: Define primary, secondary, accent colors, and any shades used for backgrounds, text, borders, etc.
Example: Primary Color (e.g., #1F1F1F), Secondary Color (e.g., #F5F5F5), Accent Color (e.g., #161C2B).
Typography: Specify fonts, sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing for headings, paragraphs, and buttons.
Example: Use consistent font families (e.g., 'Roboto', 'Open Sans') for headings, body text, and labels.
Spacing & Grids: Define margins, padding, and grid system for layout consistency.
Example: Use an 8pt grid system for spacing.
Iconography: A set of consistent icons for user interaction elements.
Example: Define sizes (24x24, 16x16) and styles for icons (e.g., filled or outline).
Elevation/Depth: Define shadow and elevation styles to create visual hierarchy.
Components:

Buttons: Define styles for primary, secondary, and disabled states.
Example: A raised button with a primary background and white text.
Forms/Inputs: Specify how form elements like text fields, checkboxes, and dropdowns should look and behave.
Example: Input fields with clear label positioning, error handling, and focus states.
Cards: Components to group related content with a consistent look.
Example: A card may have a shadow and padding, with space for a header, content, and actions.
Navigation (Menus, Tabs, Sidebars): Define styles for navigating between different sections or views.
Example: Side navigation with highlighted active items and proper spacing.
Modals/Dialogs: Define how modal windows should appear and behave (e.g., modal backgrounds, close buttons).
Patterns:

Feedback: Consistent styles for alerts, notifications, success, error, or warning messages.
Example: Use specific colors (green for success, red for error) and iconography to communicate feedback.
Animations & Transitions: Define how components transition on user interaction.
Example: Smooth fade-in for modals or buttons that slightly scale when clicked.
Loading States: Visual indicators to show the app is processing something (spinners, skeleton loaders).
Example: Circular loading spinners or skeleton screens while content is being fetched.
Accessibility Guidelines:

Contrast Ratios: Ensure that text and background colors meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) contrast standards.
Keyboard Navigation: Make sure all interactive elements can be navigated via keyboard.
Screen Reader Support: Use appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels and roles for elements.
Guidelines for Interaction & Motion:

Gestures: Define how users interact with the application using touch gestures, swipes, or long presses.
Motion/Animations: Guidelines on when to use animations, how long they should last, and their purpose (e.g., draw attention or indicate progress).
Documentation & Usage:

How-to Guides: Provide detailed guidelines on how to use the design system in both design tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch) and in code (e.g., React, Flutter).
